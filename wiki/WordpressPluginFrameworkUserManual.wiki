= Introduction =

The Wordpress Plugin Framework (WPF) is a PHP class that is used to provide a framework for the development of Wordpress plugins. The overall intention of the WPF is to generalize and simplify plugin design while also helping plugins adhere to a common administration and usage standard. This manual will help guide you in the development and implementation of a Wordpress plugin derived from the WPF base class.

= Getting Started =

This section will provide a strategy for the creation of a plugin based from the WPF.

NOTE: Throughout this document I will reference the design and development of a fictional "My Test Plugin" that resides in the "my-test-plugin" folder and is implemented as the "my-test-plugin.php" file. 

== Creating a Plugin Package ==

The first step to developing any Wordpress plugin is to create a plugin package. This package consists of a specially named folder to contain your plugin files and a specially named file that is your main plugin file.

So for our example plugin design we will need to create:
  * "my-test-plugin" folder.
  * "my-test-plugin.php" file within the "my-test-plugin" folder.
